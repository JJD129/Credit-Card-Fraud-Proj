# Credit-Card-Fraud-Proj

n this project-based course, you will learn how to use R to identify fraudulent credit card transactions with a variety of classification methods and use R to generate synthetic samples to address the common problem of classification bias for highly imbalanced datasets—the class of interest (fraud) represents less than 1% of the observations. 

## Objective:

1. Create, train, and evaluate decision tree, naïve Bayes, and Linear discriminant analysis classification models using R.

2. Generate synthetic samples to improve the performance of your models.
